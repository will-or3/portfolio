## Breadth Project: Defensive Mitigations for Vulnerable Software
## ! This is not Finished !
**Overview:**  
Even well-tested software can contain vulnerabilities. This project explores defensive strategies that protect software **without modifying the original vulnerable code**

**Key Learning Areas:**

- **Understanding how attackers exploit vulnerabilities**, such as:  
  - Stack-based buffer overflows  
  - Use-after-free errors  
  - Format string vulnerabilities

- **Exploring defensive mitigation techniques**:  
  - Pointer obfuscation  
  - Runtime integrity checks  
  - Anti-debug / anti-tamper methods
  - Pre-runtime obfuscation / encryption  
  - Checksum and hash verification for critical data
